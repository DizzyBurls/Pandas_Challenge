# Pandas Challenge

    Homework Task 4
    Writen by Chris Burley

# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 4
    Part Names: (1) PyCitySchools   (2) Conclusions

# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the task. 
	They provide answers that exactly replicate those provided in the solutions, including formatting. 
	See screen captures 1 - 9 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show each of the 9 main tables that students were required to create.

# Activation of a script:

	To run these scripts: 

	(1) Open the Jupyter Source File which can be found in my Git Hub repository.

	(2) Run it in a Jupyter notebook.
    
	(3) Run the scripts in the order that they appear.
